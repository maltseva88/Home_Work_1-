## Recommendations

* *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*

Cashless payments accelerate and pandemic safe. If I were Jack Dorsey I would expand SQ online payments business for the regular people making them pay their household expenses with square (connect all the essential household payments such as ConEdison, Rent Payments, Spectrum etc.) offering cash back if you pay with SQ and giving extra discount on setting an autopay. 
Go international with the peer to peer online apps. Making it easier make wire transfers across the globe. Example: I am a freelancer working remote from Indonesian island, I want to pay my rent for a room I am renting via CashApp or any other app connected to the cashless ecosystem getting a fair currency exchange. 

Future of the work is remote: If people transact via CashApp so it would be easier if peole would get their paychecks to the CashApp too, eliminating the banks. Encorage small businesses to pay their employees directly to mobile apps.  


* *Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*

Money flow is higher. Gather information on the customers (Know Your Customer) better serve the needs and provide tailored opportunities. Getting a market share of the retail banks money making mechanisms. 


* *What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*

Computational Technologies! 

Currency Exchange converter 
Online Banking technology
SWIFT Technology 
Instant deposits (AI in the image recognition)
Face Recognition 
Secure online payments


* *Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*
These are the currently used technology by the competitors in the market place. Combining technologies will accelerate the progress in the field. Computational power and combining technologies will provide more opportunities to gain the market share and offer more service to the users.
